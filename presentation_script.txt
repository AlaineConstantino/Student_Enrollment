LIVE DEMO WALKTHROUGH SCRIPT
Student Enrollment System - Laravel Web Application Final Project

INTRODUCTION (Before Screen Share)
Script:
Good day everyone. For our final project, we developed a full-stack Student Enrollment System web application using the Laravel PHP framework.
I will now walk you through our system and demonstrate its main features, including user authentication, role-based access, CRUD operations, database integration, and security features.

PART 1: LANDING PAGE
Action:
Open the website homepage
Script:
This is the landing page of our Student Enrollment System.
From here, users can either register for a new account or log in if they already have an existing account.
The system manages students, classes, enrollments, grades, and payments.

PART 2: USER REGISTRATION
Action:
Click Register
Fill form: Name: Alaine Constantino, Email: alaine@student.com, Password: password123
Script:
I will start by demonstrating the user registration process.
The system requires users to provide valid information, and all inputs are validated on the server side.
Action:
Submit the form
Script:
Once the form is submitted, the password is securely hashed before being stored in the MySQL database on Railway.

PART 3: LOGIN & AUTHENTICATION
Action:
Go to Login
Enter: Email: alaine@student.com, Password: password123
Click Login
Script:
After registration, users can log in using their credentials.
Laravel's authentication system verifies the email and password against the database, ensuring secure access.
(Optional Error Demo)
Enter wrong password once
Script:
If incorrect credentials are entered, the system displays a user-friendly error message.

PART 4: DASHBOARD OVERVIEW
Action:
Show dashboard after login
Script:
After logging in, the user is redirected to the dashboard based on their role.
This dashboard displays the available features for admins, teachers, or students.

PART 5: ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
If Admin Account
Action:
Show admin menus (User, Student, Class, Enrollment, Grade, Payment Management)
Script:
This account is an admin account.
Admin users have access to manage all records, view all users, and perform full CRUD operations on students, classes, enrollments, grades, and payments.

If Teacher Account
Action:
Log in with: Email: teacher@brightminds.edu, Password: password123
Show teacher dashboard with classes and students
Script:
Teacher accounts have access to their assigned classes, students, and grades.

If Student/Parent Account
Action:
Show user dashboard with personal info and enrollments
Script:
Student users can view their profile, enroll in classes, view grades, and payments.

PART 6: CREATE FUNCTION (CRUD – CREATE) - Add a Student
Action:
Go to Student Management > Add Student
Fill form: Student Name: John Smith, Program: Information Technology, Guardian Name: Mary Smith, Contact: 123-456-7890
Script:
I will now demonstrate the create function by adding a new student.
Users can add new records by filling out the form, which is validated before submission.
Action:
Submit form
Script:
After submission, the data is saved to the database using Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

PART 7: READ FUNCTION (CRUD – READ) - View Students
Action:
Show students table/list
Script:
This page displays all existing students.
The data shown here is retrieved directly from the MySQL database.

PART 8: UPDATE FUNCTION (CRUD – UPDATE) - Edit Student
Action:
Click Edit on a student
Modify some data
Save changes
Script:
Users can also update existing records.
Any changes made are validated and then updated in the database.

PART 9: DELETE FUNCTION (CRUD – DELETE) - Delete Student
Action:
Click Delete on a student
Confirm deletion
Script:
The delete function allows users to remove records.
A confirmation is required to prevent accidental deletion.

PART 10: ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT
Action:
Go to Enrollment Management
Show pending enrollments
Approve or decline
Script:
Admins can manage enrollment requests.
Approving creates the enrollment record in the database.

PART 11: GRADE MANAGEMENT
Action:
Go to Grade Management
Assign grades to students
Script:
Teachers and admins can assign grades, which are stored in the database.

PART 12: PAYMENT MANAGEMENT
Action:
Go to Payment Management
Record a payment
Script:
Payments can be recorded and viewed, with dates properly formatted.

PART 13: FORM VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING
Action:
Submit an empty or invalid form
Script:
The system prevents invalid input by displaying clear validation messages.
This ensures data integrity and improves user experience.

PART 14: DATABASE INTEGRATION (EXPLAIN ONLY)
Action:
Briefly mention database (hosted on Railway)
Script:
All records in this system are stored using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and managed through migrations, ensuring structured and secure data storage in MySQL.

PART 15: SECURITY FEATURES
Action:
Attempt to access a restricted URL (e.g., admin page as student)
Script:
The system uses authentication middleware and role checks to protect routes.
Unauthorized users cannot access restricted pages.

PART 16: LOGOUT
Action:
Click Logout
Script:
Finally, users can securely log out of the system, which ends their session and protects their account.

CONCLUSION
Script:
To conclude, this Laravel web application demonstrates authentication with database-stored credentials, role-based access control, CRUD operations on students, classes, enrollments, grades, and payments, database integration, validation, and security best practices.
Thank you, and that concludes our system demonstration.
